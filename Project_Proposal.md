## Abstract

In modern computing environments, efficient CPU scheduling is critical for optimal system performance, especially in multicore processors that dominate contemporary computing architectures. Traditional scheduling algorithms such as First-Come, First-Served (FCFS), Round Robin (RR), and Shortest Remaining Time First (SRTF) each have distinct advantages but perform optimally only under specific workload conditions. This project proposes and implements an **Adaptive Hybrid Scheduling System** that intelligently selects and switches between multiple scheduling algorithms based on real-time system state analysis, workload characteristics, and performance metrics.

The motivation behind this work stems from the observation that no single scheduling algorithm performs optimally across all scenarios. CPU-intensive workloads benefit from load balancing strategies, while I/O-intensive processes perform better with priority-based scheduling. Short processes minimize waiting time with SJF, while long-running processes require fair time-sharing through Round Robin. Our adaptive scheduler addresses this challenge by continuously monitoring system conditions (load level, process characteristics, core utilization) and dynamically selecting the most appropriate scheduling algorithm.

The project implements a comprehensive simulation framework in Python that models multicore CPU scheduling with seven different algorithms, including our novel adaptive hybrid scheduler. Through extensive simulation and performance evaluation, we demonstrate that the adaptive approach achieves 10-20% better performance across key metrics compared to fixed-algorithm strategies, making it highly suitable for modern heterogeneous workloads.

## 2. Motivation

### 2.1 Background

Modern computing systems face increasingly diverse and dynamic workloads. From web servers handling variable request patterns to scientific computing with mixed CPU and I/O operations, the nature of processes varies significantly. Traditional CPU scheduling algorithms were designed with specific assumptions and optimization goals, making them effective for certain scenarios but suboptimal for others.

### 2.2 The Problem with Fixed Scheduling

Consider the following limitations of traditional approaches:

- **FCFS (First-Come, First-Served)**: Simple but suffers from the convoy effect where short processes wait behind long ones, leading to poor average waiting time.

- **SJF (Shortest Job First)**: Optimal for minimizing average waiting time but can cause starvation of longer processes and requires accurate burst time prediction.

- **Round Robin**: Provides fairness and good response time but can have high context switch overhead and suboptimal throughput for varying process lengths.

- **Priority Scheduling**: Allows important processes to execute first but risks starvation of low-priority processes without aging mechanisms.

### 2.3 Need for Adaptive Scheduling

In real-world systems:
- **Workload variability**: Systems experience changing workload characteristics throughout their operation
- **Multicore complexity**: Load balancing across multiple cores adds another dimension of optimization
- **Performance trade-offs**: Different metrics (turnaround time, waiting time, throughput, fairness) cannot all be simultaneously optimized by a single algorithm
- **Context sensitivity**: Optimal scheduling strategy depends on current system state

### 2.4 Project Motivation

This project is motivated by:

1. **Academic Interest**: Understanding the theoretical and practical aspects of CPU scheduling in modern systems

2. **Performance Optimization**: Achieving better overall system performance through intelligent algorithm selection

3. **Real-world Applicability**: Developing techniques applicable to actual operating system schedulers

4. **Research Contribution**: Demonstrating that adaptive approaches can significantly outperform traditional fixed-algorithm strategies

5. **Educational Value**: Creating a comprehensive framework for studying and comparing scheduling algorithms

## 3. Project Description

### 3.1 Overview

This project develops a comprehensive CPU scheduling simulation framework that implements and compares multiple scheduling algorithms with a focus on an innovative **Adaptive Hybrid Scheduler**. The system simulates a multicore processor environment where processes with varying characteristics (arrival time, burst time, priority, CPU/IO intensity) are scheduled for execution.

### 3.2 System Architecture

The project consists of several integrated components:

#### 3.2.1 Core Simulation Engine
- **Process Model**: Represents individual processes with states (NEW, READY, RUNNING, WAITING, TERMINATED), timing attributes, and resource requirements
- **CPU Core Model**: Simulates individual processor cores with utilization tracking, load monitoring, and execution management
- **Scheduler Interface**: Abstract base class defining the scheduling algorithm interface, allowing modular implementation of different strategies

#### 3.2.2 Implemented Scheduling Algorithms

**Traditional Algorithms:**
1. **FCFS (First-Come, First-Served)**: Non-preemptive algorithm that processes tasks in arrival order
2. **SJF (Shortest Job First)**: Non-preemptive algorithm that prioritizes shortest burst time
3. **SRTF (Shortest Remaining Time First)**: Preemptive version of SJF
4. **Round Robin**: Preemptive time-sharing with configurable quantum
5. **Priority Scheduling**: Preemptive/non-preemptive priority-based with aging

**Multicore-Specific Algorithms:**

2. **Algorithm Selection**: Based on current state:
   - High load + CPU-intensive → Load Balancing
   - High load + Long processes → Round Robin
   - Medium load + Short processes → SJF
   - Medium load + I/O-intensive → Priority
   - Low load + Mixed workload → Work Stealing

3. **Dynamic Switching**: Seamlessly transitions between algorithms when conditions change

4. **Performance Tracking**: Monitors effectiveness of each algorithm selection

#### 3.2.4 Metrics Collection System

Comprehensive performance tracking including:
- Average turnaround time (arrival to completion)
- Average waiting time (time in ready queue)
- Average response time (arrival to first execution)
- CPU utilization (percentage of time cores are busy)

      if load_ratio < 1.0: state = LOW_LOAD
      elif load_ratio < 3.0: state = MEDIUM_LOAD
      else: state = HIGH_LOAD
   
   c. Classify workload:

      elif io_bound_ratio > 0.6: workload = IO_INTENSIVE
      elif avg_burst < 10ms: workload = SHORT_JOBS
      elif avg_burst > 50ms: workload = LONG_JOBS
      else: workload = MIXED
   
   d. Select algorithm based on state-workload combination:
      Decision Matrix:
